- Hi, I’m @Luciana-Baruffaldi.
- I am a Research Associate in Professor Maydianne Andrade’s Laboratory in the Department of Biological Sciences at UTSC (https://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/labs/andrade/personnel).
- I have more than 20 years of experience planning, designing and leading STEM outreach activities that are age and grade-appropriate, and that includes hands-on activities.
- I found a great joy in working alongside students, and in supporting them in facilitating student learning in the classroom and in the laboratory.
- My mission is to increase access to and engagement with STEM among students through workshops and hands-on activities that support inclusive practices.  
- Over the years I have taken personal development courses to improve my teaching and leading skills with a focus on accessibility, universal design for learning, mentoring minorities and unconscious bias in STEM.
- I was born in Uruguay a tiny, beautiful place in South America and then I came to Canada to do my PhD in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at the University of Toronto.
- ⚡ Fun fact I was arachnophobic as a kid and now I work with widow spiders
